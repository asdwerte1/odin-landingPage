<h1>Odin Project: Landing Page</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>A simple assignment from the Odin Project which requires creating of a page which mimics a pre-designed page</p>
<p>Two images are attatched which show the aimed for layout and some information about fonts and colours</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>The challenge was a little harder than first anticipated. I decided to only use the knowledge covered in the Odin Project spec so far and not use my own knowledge from topics like Bootstrap or SASS to increase the challeneg and practice using the intended aspects of HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Whilst the final product does not match the image exactly I am happy with the outcome. A main reason is that the image is highly zoomed out - if the HTML page is zoomed out to approx 66.6% then it will match closely in a half-sized window.</p>
<p>I also stuck to a more basic font as I did not have Roboto available and decided this was not a necesity.</p>
